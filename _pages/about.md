I am an Associate Research Scientist at Columbia University, where I work under the supervision of Dr. Diana Hernández across both the Energy, Equity, Housing and Health (E2H2) Program at Mailman School of Public Health and Energy Opportunity Lab (EOL) in the Center on Global Energy Policy at the School of International and Public Affairs. My research aims to develop a better understanding of how to design and implement policies that promote renewable energy deployment, phase out fossil fuels, and advance energy justice. I am passionate about utilizing computational text analysis and social network analysis in my research. Currently, I am working on projects funded by National Science Foundation (NSF), the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation, and Columbia University's internal seed grant.

My sole-authored and coauthored publications appear in Energy Research & Social Science, Energy Strategy Reviews, Climatic Change, Frontiers in Sustainable Cities, Journal of Chinese Governance, and Chinese Public Administration Review. I received my PhD in Public Policy from Northeastern University (Boston) in 2024. In support of my dissertation work, I hold a Fall 2022 Experiential Fellowship from Northeastern’s College of Social Sciences and Humanities. My dissertation work was also partially funded by Northeastern University’s Transforming Interdisciplinary Experiential Research (TIER) 1 Seed Grant and a grant from Brown University’s Climate Social Science Network (CSSN).
